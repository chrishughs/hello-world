# hello-world
My first GitHub repository!

I've just started playing around in GitHub as I begin my coding journey.
When I'm not on a learning binge, I'm usually traveling (sometimes while learning to code),
being outside (hiking or camping), dj'ing (or listening to music), and snowboarding in the winter.
